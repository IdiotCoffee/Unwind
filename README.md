This is my second hackathon project.
<br>
<p>
Unwind is a website curated to help users relax and, well, unwind! The website has many features including relaxing music, inspirational podcasts, simple activities such as journaling and much more. <br>
It also tracks the users' mental health using some control questions so that users can check if the activities suggested by the website are helping their mental condition.<br>
We also provided a community for users with similar problems to come together and help each other.
</p>
<p>
I made this project with the help of three other group members:<br>
<ul>
<li>Shreyans Jain: https://github.com/ShreyansJain07<br>
<li>Rishab Mandal:https://github.com/RishabMandal<br>
<li>Krish Manghani:https://github.com/krish1718<br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Our website won the prize for TOP 10 in this hackathon.
