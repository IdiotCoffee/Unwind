This is my second hackathon project.
<br>
<p>
Unwind is a website curated to help users relax and, well, unwind! The website has many features including relaxing music, inspirational podcasts, simple activities such as journaling and much more. <br>
It also tracks the users' mental health using some control questions so that users can check if the activities suggested by the website are helping their mental condition.<br>
We also provided a community for users with similar problems to come together and help each other. The website also recommends therapists with expertise in various fields for users with specialized issues.
</p>
<p>The website tracks the progress of the user by giving them badges for logging in everyday and completing their tasks. We also introduced a currency called zencoins that can be availed to access discounts on your next therapy session.
